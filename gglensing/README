This README file contains the detailed description about
the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal from SDSS DR7.

Firstly, you need to Decompress gglensing.tar.gz
using the tar command from linux system:

$tar -xzvf gglensing.tar.gz

In gglensing directory there are:

1, LuminosityBins, containing 
   I) lum_all subdirectory. In this directory
      there are shear_1, shear_2, shear_3, shear4,
      shear_5,shear_6 files, denoting measured lensing signals
      binned in 6 luminosity bins. 
     
     In each file, 
     (1).the first column is the projected
         distance wrt the center of the group(central galaxy).
         in comoving distance(Mpc/h); 
     (2).the second column is the signal, 
         a.k.a ESD(Excess Surface Density, M_sun/pc^2).
     (3).the third column is the error estimated using bootstrap.
     (4). The covar_1.fits,covar_2.fits, covar_3.fits, covar_4.fits 
         ,covar_5.fits, covar_6.fits are the covariance matrix among the
         data points also estimated via bootstrap.

	The reading of fits file in IDL and python are:

           IDL>covar=readfits('covar_1.fits')

	   Python(pyfits library is required to be installed in advance.)
           >> import pyfits 
           >> hdu  =pyfits.open('covar_1.fits')
           >> covar=hdu[0].data
   
   II) red_blue subdirectory contains the signal measured from
       red and blue subsamples, which have the same structure as
       shear_1 to shear_6 in lum_all. And the covariance matrix for each
       luminosity bin and color are covar_r1.fits to covar_r6.fits with r
       denoting red galaxy samples. covar_b1 to covar_b6 are for the blue galaxy
       samples.
2, StellarBins, containing
   I) Sterllar_all galaxy samples binned in stellar mass. The stellar mass
      for each galaxy is estimated using the method from Bell et al 2003.
      From shear_1 to shear_7, the structure are the same as above for lum_all.
      covar_1.fits to covar_7.fits are the covariance matrix in fits format.
   II)  red_blue subsamples divided by color
   III) sf_qu subsamples divided into star forming(sf) and quenched(qu) galaxy samples.

We do not include Rachel Mandelbaum's Signal here.
